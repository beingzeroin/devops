## Architecture

At the hardware level, a Kubernetes cluster node can be

* a *master* node, which hosts the **Kubernetes Control Plane** that manages the state of the cluster
    - The **Kubernetes API Server** to communicate with the cluster
    - The **Scheduler**, which schedules apps (assigns a worker node to each deployable component)
    - The **Controller Manager**, which performs cluster-level functions, such as replicating components, keeping track of worker nodes handling node failures, and so on
    - **etcd**, a reliable distributed data store that persistently stores the cluster configuration
* a *worker* nodes that run containerized applications
    - Docker, rkt, or another **container runtime**, which runs containers
    - The **Kubelet**, which talks to the API server and manages containers on its node
    - The **Kubernetes Service Proxy (kube-proxy)**, which load-balances network traffic between application components

![kubernetes-architecture](img/kubernetes-architecture.png)

* To run an application in Kubernetes, it needs to be packaged into one or more container images, those images need to be pushed to an image registry, and then a description of the app posted to the Kubernetes API Server
* When the API server processes the app's description, the Scheduler schedules (pods are run immediately) the specified groups of containers onto the available worker nodes based on computational resources required by each group and the unallocated resources on each node at that moment
* The Kubelet on those nodes then instructs the Container Runtime (Docker, for example) to pull the required container images and run the containers
* Once the application is running, Kubernetes continuously makes sure that the deployed state of the application always matches the description you provided
* To allow clients to easily find containers that provide a specific service, it's possible to tell Kubernetes which containers provide the same service and Kubernetes will expose all of them at a single static IP address and expose that address to all applications running in the cluster
* User interacts with the cluster through the `kubectl` command line client, which issues REST requests to the Kubernetes API server running on the master node

![kubernetes-run](img/kubernetes-run.png)

* One of the most fundamental Kubernetes principles is that instead of telling Kubernetes exactly what actions it should perform, you're only *declaratively changing the desired state* of the system and letting Kubernetes examine the current actual state and *reconcile* it with the desired state

* *Resource* definition example

```
apiVersion: v1
# type of resource
kind: Pod
# includes the name, namespace, labels, and other information about the pod
metadata:
  ...
# contains the actual description of the pod's contents,
# such as the pod's containers, volumes, and other data
spec:
  ...
# contains the current information about the running pod,
# such as what condition the pod is in, the description and status of each container,
# and the pod's internal IP and other basic info
status:
  ...
```

* A **label** is an arbitrary key-value pair you attach to a resource, which is then utilized when selecting resources using *label selectors* and a resource can have more than one label
* **Annotations** are key-value pairs like labels, but they aren't meant to hold identifying information and can hold up to 256 KB
* Using multiple **namespaces** allows to split complex systems with numerous components into smaller distinct groups and resource names only need to be unique within a namespace
* A **pod** is a group of one or more tightly related containers that will always run together on the same worker node and in the same Linux namespace(s). Each pod is like a separate logical machine with its own IP, hostname, processes, and so on, running a single application
* A **ReplicationController** is a resource that ensures its pods are always kept running and an exact number of pods always matches its label selector, even if a node disappears. It's made by
    - a *label selector*, which determines what pods are in the ReplicationController's scope
    - a *replica count*, which specifies the desired number of pods that should be running
    - a *pod template*, which is used when creating new pod replicas
* A **ReplicaSet** behaves exactly like a ReplicationController (old), but it has more expressive pod selectors
* A **DaemonSet** is mostly for specific case like infrastructure-related pods that perform system-level operations in which a pod must run on each and every node in the cluster and each node needs to run exactly one instance of the pod, for example log collector and resource monitor
* A **Job** resource allows to run a pod whose container isn't restarted when the process running inside finishes successfully. A cron job in Kubernetes is configured by creating a **CronJob** resource
* A **Service** represents a static location for a group of one or more pods that all provide the same service. Requests coming to the IP and port of the service will be forwarded/load-balanced to the IP and port of one of the pods belonging to the service at that moment
    - *ExternalName* type, a service that serves as an alias for an external service
    - *NodePort* type, each cluster node opens a port on the node itself and redirects traffic received on that port to the underlying service
    - *LoadBalancer* type (extension of NodePort), makes the service accessible through a dedicated load balancer which usually is  supported and automatically provisioned by the cloud infrastructure
* A *headless service* still provides load balancing across pods, but through the DNS round-robin mechanism instead of through the service proxy, because DNS returns the pods' IPs, clients connect directly to the pods, instead of through the service proxy. Setting the *clusterIP* field in a service spec to *None* makes the service headless
* An **Endpoints** resource is a list of IP addresses and ports exposing a service. The Endpoints object needs to have the same name as the service and contain the list of target IP addresses and ports for the service
* An **Ingress** operates at the application layer of the network stack (HTTP) and can provide features such as cookie-based session affinity. LoadBalancer service requires its own load balancer with its own public IP address, whereas an Ingress only requires one
* The Kubelet on the node hosting the pod can check if a container is still alive through **liveness probes** using *httpGet*, *tcpSocket* or *exec*. Exit code is a sum of `128 + N` e.g. `137 = 128 + 9` (SIGKILL) or `143 = 128 + 15` (SIGTERM). Always remember to set an initial delay *initialDelaySeconds*
* The **readiness probes** is invoked periodically and determines whether the specific pod should receive client requests or not. Liveness probes keep pods healthy by killing off unhealthy containers and replacing them with new, healthy ones, whereas readiness probes make sure that only pods that are ready to serve requests receive them and this is mostly necessary during container start up
* A **volume** is a component of a pod and not a standalone object, it cannot be created or deleted on its own. A volume is available to all containers in the pod, but it must be mounted in each container that needs to access it
    - *emptyDir*, a simple empty directory used for storing transient data
    - *hostPath*, used for mounting directories from the worker node's filesystem into the pod
    - *gitRepo*, a volume initialized by checking out the contents of a Git repository
    - *nfs*, an NFS share mounted into the pod
    - *gcePersistentDisk* (Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk), *awsElasticBlockStore* (Amazon Web Services Elastic Block Store Volume), *azureDisk* (Microsoft Azure Disk Volume), used for mounting cloud provider-specific storage
    - *cinder, cephfs, iscsi, flocker, glusterfs, quobyte, rbd, flexVolume, vsphereVolume, photonPersistentDisk, scaleIO*, used for mounting other types of network storage
    - *configMap, secret, downwardAPI*, a special types of volumes used to expose certain Kubernetes resources and cluster information to the pod
    - *persistentVolumeClaim*, a way to use a pre- or dynamically provisioned persistent storage

![kubernetes-volume](img/kubernetes-volume.png)

* An app can be configured by
    - passing command-line arguments to containers with `command` and `args`
    - setting custom environment variables for each container of a pod
    - mounting configuration files into containers through a special type of volume
* The contents of a **ConfigMap** are passed to containers as either environment variables or as files in a volume while on the nodes
* **Secrets** are always stored in memory and never written to physical storage (maximum size of a Secret is limited to 1MB)
* The **Downward API** enables you to expose the pod's own metadata to the processes running inside that pod (it isn't a REST endpoint)

![kubernetes-container-api](img/kubernetes-container-api.png)

* Rolling update means replace pods step by step slowly scaling down the previous version and scaling up the new one
* A **Deployment** is a higher-level resource meant for deploying applications and updating them declaratively, instead of doing it through a ReplicationController or a ReplicaSet, which are both considered lower-level concepts. A Deployment doesn't manage pods directly, instead it creates a new ReplicaSet which is scaled up slowly, while the previous ReplicaSet is scaled down to zero.
