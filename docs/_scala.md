Definition

> An expression `e` is **referentially transparent** if, for all programs `p`,
all occurrences of `e` in `p` can be replaced by the result of evaluating `e` without affecting the meaning of `p`.
A function `f` is **pure** if the expression `f(x)` is referentially transparent for all referentially transparent `x`.
Hence a pure function is **modular** and **composable**
